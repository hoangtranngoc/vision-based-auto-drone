# Vision-based-auto-drone Thesis at HiOf
Just collect all the implementation here. This project requires specific UE4 Simulated Environments to run.
Keras implementation that trained navigation models and detection models.
"flying" dir contains scripts regarding  AirSim for collecting training data, testing, log handling, etc.
"training" dir contains scripts regarding training DNN models for navigation (ResNet18, MobileNetV2, NasNet, DenseNet121, SqueezeNet) and detection (SSD).
